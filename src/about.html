  <h1>Story of STU</h1>

  <p>
    Scarborough Tenants Union (STU) is a grass-root movement formed of our
    necessity to save lives during COVID 2020 in Scarborough. After publicly
    mandating no evictions during the emergency lock-down, provincial
    governments quietly allowed eviction applications to be processed at Ontario
    Landlord and Tenants Board. After corrupting politicians with private wealth
    and fortunes, big corporations were able use police force to evict tenants
    who fell behind rent payments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The legitimacy of the argument was that tenants failed to pay rent after
    receiving money that supposed to bailout landlords from banks. As a result,
    the most vulnerable population was subject to work under dangerous
    environment in order to meet the high cost of living and feed families
    during the most uncertain time. Simultaneously, the low wage workers were
    forced to organize in the community to protect families from corporate
    dispatched police violence in Toronto.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out of necessity, tenants in Scarborough came together to form union that
    became the Scarborough Tenants Union in April 2020. STU successfully
    resisted over 30 illegal evictions at 945 Midland Avenue and in the
    neighborhoods. The primary role of the union was to educate, inform and
    provide community legal resources to tenants while responding to immediate
    threats and harassments from corporate landlords.

    The STU currently headed by Kiri Vadivelu, continue to operate in arm length
    of several grass-root community organizations to provide community services
    to tenants across the city. In collaboration,
