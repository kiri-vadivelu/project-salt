"In a city such as Toronto, where the cost of food, transportation, shelter is so high â€¦ we're talking thousands and thousands of households who are barely making it."

York Street and Lake Shore Boulevard sat unoccupied for months until the prices dropped by several hundred dollars and landlords started including incentives like two months' free rent, parking or gift cards.

But that's cold comfort for low- and middle-income renters, like Vadivelu and Gordon.

"It's just a creative way to market it and bring more and more rental income," said Vadivelu.

"Real tenants, they're not seeing any rent reduction."
