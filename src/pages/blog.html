    We learn lot from our history; most importantly we learn more from sharing
    of our individual experience in the collective universe. Sadly, the history
    is being disregarded by the mainstream in order to maintain the comfortable
    lies that our society is a fair place for all.

    If that was true, police would protect tenants and landlords without
    discrimination based on social status. The gruesome pandemic evictions in
    Toronto by our Toronto Police across the city revealed the historical fact
    that police exist to serve the ruling class and the corporations.

    Therefore, STU stand united in solidarity with oppressed and the exploited
    everywhere. Respectively, every STU meeting is mandated to begin with
    Scarborough land acknowledgment.
  </p>

  <p class="land-acknowledgement">
    The land STU stand today is the traditional territory of many nations
    including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the
    Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First
    Nations, Inuit and MeÃÅtis peoples. STU acknowledge that Toronto is covered by
    Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams
    Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.
